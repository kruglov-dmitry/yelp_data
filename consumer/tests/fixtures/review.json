We were advised the shipment would arrive in 3 business days.  The shipment was delivered the same day as promised.  We received excellent service from the first step into their showroom at their location on Dean Martin, all thru the delivery.  Very positive experience and great pricing for the quality items we purchased.  Very pleased and will be purchasing more furniture from this store.","date":"2015-07-03 21:48:51"},

Not only that the service was good, the food is good the serving is good and the service is amazing. The best part is the price is really good.\nA perfect location with lots of parking and the place looks really clean. They have an awesome lunch special that is too plenty making it very filling for the price that you're paying for. That is why this is one of the Japanese restaurants that I recommend for lunch specials with friends ,colleagues,Or if you are just lazy to cook. I love this place I will keep coming back here.","date":"2019-12-07 00:29:55"}
